# python

My first step to learn programming. I find that python is well intuitive for beginners like me. After that I'm planning to study C.
I was thinking about going C++ or Java after (stocked up materials to learn the latter).

Will see.

I take no credit for included exercises as they are done based on 'Zed Shaw's Lern Python3 the Hard Way'.
